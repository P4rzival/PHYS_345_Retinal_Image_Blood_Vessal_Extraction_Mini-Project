Notes: It is really not a pretty result. With my understanding of image processing, I do not know a clear way to remove a lot of this ruptured eye and keep veins. This is beyond our ability at this time. My hypothesis would be using some sort of AI to track the veins. However, we are left with a good idea of the tortuosity of the veins themselves and the absolutely obliterated state of the retinal blood vessels in this individual eye.
