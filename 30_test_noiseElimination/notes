Notes:

The original photo has some sort of glair around the periphery. This is very noticeable in the lower left of the photo and can be seen slightly throughout the rest of the edge. 

After changing types to 8-bit, this glared portion is obviously lossy on data. Veins are not clear and the finer details that are constant throughout the retinal photo are missing in the lower left portion.

I have subtracted the background from the image and adjusted the photo's contrast. The photo shows a lot of noise in any portion that had the glare in the original photo. Noise is present about the periphery, fovea, and optic  nerve.

To try to reduce the noise, I used a smoothing mask in convolution, but as the text book says, this process is not helpful. The result was an enhanced noise as well as extra lossy data.

Gausian Blurring was equally as un-helpful. From here I really do not know what we can do about the noise. There really isnt a route that I can think of to eliminate the noise without doing it by hand. I feel at this portion we are stuck. If I had to consider a method to remove this noise, I would want to use some neural net or AI system to clarify the photo. However at that point we might not use any of the previous methods to do so.
