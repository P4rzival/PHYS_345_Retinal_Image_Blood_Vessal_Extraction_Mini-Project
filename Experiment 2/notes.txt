Notes: This is a very clean result. I believe the lower numbered test photos are the intentions of the professor to see our ability to clean noise from a photo. Unfortunately this has been very illusive without losing a lot of quality in the veins. This observation closely echoes what is written in the textbook about smoothing retinal photos.
